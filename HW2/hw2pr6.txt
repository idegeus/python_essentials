The most difficult exercise was the labyrinth map, in picobot. The syntax of
picobot especially was difficult fo figure out, since it has no real way to
set a variable. While you are able to set a state, the program will only execute
one rule per step.

Python is quite different in that way, it seems more like natural languages.
You can set variables, execute functions when needed, and seems much more
flexible than Picobot. One side-note is needed, I have programmed in
languages which felt like Python before, so it might actually have handicapped
me in my thinking in this excercise.
