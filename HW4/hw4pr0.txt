What is an application that (in your opinion) Watson’s
technology might be able to contribute to? Alternatively,
do you feel Watson’s capabilities will not make much of an
impact? You can look around for web articles on this,
or you’re welcome to speculate.

I think Watson's technology will come in most handy, in situations
where large amounts of data have to be processed. Think about medical
diagnosis, weather data simulation, NSA surveillance. This is
a situation where a computer that can process large quantities of data
very quickly can outperform humans.
