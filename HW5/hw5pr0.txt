Are we actually in a simulation? Yes? No? Maybeâ€¦? Why do you think so (or not)?
I actually think there is no way to know if we are in a simulation or not. If
you have seen the Matrix before, most people there have sensory input from the
machine, and are unable to understand everything they feel is not real. It's like
the brain in a vat experiment. We just have to assume everything we see is real,
because we are unable to ever know.
