The earthquakes article raises the question,
How can we know if your computer program/model
is ‘right’? Based on the information in that article,
how do you think computer scientists/scientists/mathematicians/engineers
can ensure that their (our) models are correct? Can we at all?

I think we are able to make a distinction between computer program and
models. Models are meant to represent the real world, and are an abstraction.
They should be as close to real as possible. These are by definition leaving
some details behind, and will never be correct in taking all the variables.
Computer programs are a different story altogether though. When we build them,
they are created with only the knowledge of the programmer in mind, and will always
be correct in the way that the programmer made them.
